# Cancer-Prediction

Breast cancer the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases 
and affected 2.1 million people in 2015 early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival.

The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign using machine learning
techniques and how it can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis.

Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while
91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.

Using Visulization and Machine Learning techniques I have classified the tumor as benign or malignant.

As you see my python code you will be able to understand what I have done.
